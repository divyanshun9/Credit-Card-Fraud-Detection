# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud detection is an important problem in the finance industry. Here's a general outline of a possible project for building a Credit card fraud detection system:

Data collection: data used here is from kaggle

Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data and normalizing the data.

Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed data, such as transaction amount, merchant type, transaction location, and time of day.

Model selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for Credit card fraud fraud detection,we have used
1. logistic regression
2. decision trees
3. random forests

Model training: Train the selected models on the preprocessed and engineered data. Use a portion of the data for training and another portion for validation and testing.

Model evaluation: Evaluated the trained models based on metrics such as accuracy.
